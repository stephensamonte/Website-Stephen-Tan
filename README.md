# Website-Stephen-Tan

This is my personal website. This is where I show case projects I have or am working on. 

URL to deployed website:
- https://stephen-tan-website.web.app/
- https://stephen-tan-website.firebaseapp.com/

## Notes

- This website isn't perfect. There's only so much one person can do. Early on I opted to use a template as a base so that I don't have to waste so much time making it look good for different devices.
- I do not have a custom domain URL because $12 a year is a cost that is not necessary. I think that having firebaseapp in the url tells people that I use Firebase for people familiar with their services. Also I expect most people to find this link via clicking on my electronic resume or social media sites (Github & LinkedIn). 
- This website replaces my first website: https://sites.google.com/site/stephensamontetan/ 

## Environment 

- This website is primarily being edited on Windows Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Deploying Website

1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
2. In the project root directory, run `$ firebase deploy`. You will be prompted to login with your firebase credentials.
